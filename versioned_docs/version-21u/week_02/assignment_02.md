# Assignment 2

1. Create a fork of the [course material](https://github.com/Functional-Genomics-Lab/Applied-Genomics/edit/main/docs/00-overview.md)
2. Clone the [repo](https://github.com/Functional-Genomics-Lab/Applied-Genomics/edit/main/docs/00-overview.md) locally(or on giant).
3. Open up `docs/00-overview.md`
4. Add your name and semester to the Alumni table, and a link to your intro project.
5. Create a PR to the main repo.
6. Drop a link to the PR in the eLearning assignment comments(For example https://github.com/Functional-Genomics-Lab/Applied-Genomics/pull/2).

Your repo will be checked for the work we've done so far. Things we're looking for:

1. An initial commit adding a README (2 points)
2. A merge of a branch called `make` (2 points)
3. A README with instructions on how to run your code. (2 points)
4. Do the instructions in your README work? Does `make` run or does it fail for example? (2 points)

Creating the PR on your own is worth 2 points. This is testing your ability to
follow documentation and then apply it. If you can't figure it out a link to
your repo in the eLearning assignment will be fine to get graded on the rest.
