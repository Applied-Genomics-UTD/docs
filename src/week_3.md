# Reproducible Exercise :lab:

<!-- TODO -->

Something along the lines of using slurm to run bowtie on some fastq file and
getting a reference alignment. This should follow some good practices for
running one off things, but illustrate the difficulty of reproducing these
things.

# Homework

Write up a markdown doc with steps to reproduce a basic workflow from the exercise.
