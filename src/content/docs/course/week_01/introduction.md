## This is not a programming class; this is a “workflows” class

<!-- TODO Remove the questioning -->

## Reproducible Research

To reduce wasted resources.

### Computing

- Use the right tool for the job.
- Running computational intensive things on your laptop is too little.
- Running jobs that are precise wastes compute time in the cluster that you or
  someone else could be using for other things.

### Money

Funding runs out. Waiting for results to come back, or reproducing old results
requires time of highly trained individuals, which is expensive.

### Time

Save time for your future self, and for researchers who come after you.

- What if you're about to graduate and your hard-drive dies(The results are too
  large for a backup on a usb)? How quickly could you reproduce that work?
- How would you work with a new undergraduate in your lab?
  - How would they make substantial contributions?
  - How would could you trust them to work on your research without fear that
    they may break something?
- When you go to write a manuscript, how would you share your code?

## How are we going to be more Reproducible?

- Avoiding homegrown solutions, instead favoring community curated efforts
- Documentation
- Version Control
- Utilizing build systems

## How big of a problem is this?
