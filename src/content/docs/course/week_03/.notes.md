# Snakemake Day 1 Notes

## Issues we ran into

1. Difference between the file, and the command line for the script
2. Not pasting the rule into the cli
3. ~mamba activate snakemake-tutorial~
4. Showing the diff between the rules
5. Snakemake not rerunning because the file is already created
6. Note the dry-run
7. Reminder of how to connect to codespaces from vscode proper

## Things to do:

- [ ] Fix conda environment activation
- [ ] Add svg preview extension
- [ ] Fix the pytest test
