Markdown is a simple markup language for formatting elements using only _plaintext_.

There's a few advantages to it over **WYSIWYG**(What You See Is What You Get) editors such as **Microsoft Word**.

- Simple formatting. Spend time writing instead of fighting margins.
- No vendor lock in. If the program you're using to display it disappears you
  still have your writing.
- Easy to version control.

Here are a few places to learn and reference:

- [Commonmark interactive tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial)
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

But the best way to learn it is to just use it!
