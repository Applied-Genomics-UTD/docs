:::Caution[Note]
Following are the expectations for the independent project assignment.
:::

The independent project, which should utilize computational or bioinformatic approaches
covered in the class, can be based on what you are familiar with or something you are
interested in learning more about. Regular exchanges with the instructors about your project
ideas are highly recommended. These exchanges will help refine your initial broad areas of
biomedical questions or interests into a specific problem, ensuring your project aligns with the
course objectives.

Some potential project ideas:

1. Reanalyze old genomic data (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq) in the context of a new genome build,
   integration of multiple data sources, and a novel combination of analyses and genomic
   data. The goal is to reveal new insights missed from prior studiesâ€”careful planning and
   selection of data would be needed.
2. Gene-centric analysis: disease-causing genes or sequence variants; identify potential
   tissues and cell types affected; identify potential mechanisms of disease action; propose
   validation experiments; propose potential interventions. This would be a more direct
   analysis but needs more research/reading and employing numerous databases and
   online resources.
3. Hypothesis-driven data mining: searching genes in disease process X; network and tissue
   analysis of genes with shared phenotypes from OMIM (physical features, genetic
   disorders, diseases); evolution of key features in species (i.e., what might have led to tail
   loss in humans); goal is to establish next set of experimentally testable hypotheses.
4. Building diagnostic assays for diseases/pathologies: collation of relevant and necessary
   genetic/epigenetic information. Proposing how the assays will work. Scoring and
   reporting of diagnosis.

The independent projects will be presented in the last two sessions of the class. Each
presentation should be about 15-20 minutes. The presentation of the project should cover four
sections:

- Rationale/Motivation/Significance
- Approaches/Data sources
- Results/Interpretations
- Conclusion/Future directions
