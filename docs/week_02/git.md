# Version Control Systems

## Why is git important for scientists?

## Intro to Git

### So what is Git?

Modern VCSs also let you easily (and often automatically) answer questions like[^2]:

    - Who wrote this code?
    - When was this particular line of this particular file edited? By whom? Why was it edited?
    - Over the last 1000 revisions, when/why did this break? (And who broke it?)

### VS Code Workflow

#### Creating a repo

First we're going to initialize a git repository. This is just a
folder/directory that has it's changes tracked by git.

1. Open up VS Code, make sure you have the [functional genomics extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=FunctionalGenomics.functional-genomics) installed
2. `CTRL+Shift+p`
3. Type in and select `Git: Initialize Repository`.
4. Choose a folder. (name it `ag-intro`)
5. Click the Open/Open in new window popup in the bottom right corner

#### Set Your Identity

In the integrated terminal put the following, but replace it with your name and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

#### First Commit

Now we're going to make our first change, stage that change, and then commit it.

1. Create a new file called `README.md`.

```md title="README.md"
# ag-intro
```

2. Select the git graph icon on the left bar(It should have a blue 1)
3. Click on the + button next to `README.md`.

Our change has now been staged! We need to commit it to the git repo

4. Type a message into the "Message" box ("Add README" would be a great message)
5. Hit `Ctrl+Enter`

That was the first commit!

#### Second commit

1. `Ctrl+p` and select `README.md`.
   - This is a handy way to jump between files in VS Code
2. Change the file to have

```md title="README.md"
# ag-intro

This is a mistake!
This will be the second commit
This will be the third commit
```

3. Select the git graph icon on the left bar(It should have a blue 1)
4. Click on the + button next to `README.md`.

This time we staged some changes we didn't mean to. We need to remove those and
break our commits up into logical sections, rather than commit everything at
once.

4. Click on the - button next to `README.md` under Staged Changes.

That just unstaged what we staged before we commited it.

5. Click on `README.md` and this will pull up a **diff**, which is the
   difference between what's committed to the repo, and the working copy.
6. Highlight the 3 and 4 lines, right click and select "Stage Selected Ranges"
7. We want to get rid of the mistake we staged, so click on `README.md` under
   "Staged Changes", highlight line 2("This is a mistake!"), right click and
   select "Unstage Selected Ranges".

Now we want to commit our changes:

8. Type a message into the "Message" box ("Update README" would be a great message)
9. Hit `Ctrl+Enter`

Now for practice, commit only the line that has "This will be the third commit"

#### Viewing changes

1. In the Source Control window, open the "COMMITS" drawer. You should see

![VS Code Commits](/img/week_02/vs_code_commits.png)

2. You can click though the "FILE HISTORY" and view old versions of the file

### So what's a remote?

> As you probably know, git is a distributed version control system. Most operations are done locally. To communicate with the outside world, git uses what are called remotes. These are repositories other than the one on your local disk which you can push your changes into (so that other people can see them) or pull from (so that you can get others changes). The command git remote add origin git@github.com:peter/first_app.gitcreates a new remote called origin located at git@github.com:peter/first_app.git. Once you do this, in your push commands, you can push to origin instead of typing out the whole URL.

#### Creating a remote

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join)
2. On the left hand side you should see Repositories and a green button that
   says New. Click it.
3. Give the repo a name. `ag-intro` is recommended.
4. Copy the code underneath "...or push an existing repository from the command line"
   Should be something similar to:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/ag-intro.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

5. In VS Code hit `Ctrl+Shift+~`, this should open up a terminal in the bottom
   of the screen. Paste the commands in there.
6. Check your GitHub repo and see if the code got pushed!
