Markdown is a simple markup language for formatting elements using only _plaintext_.

There's a few advantages to it over WYSIWYG(What You See Is What You Get)
editors such as microsoft word.

- Simple formatting. Spend time writing instead of fighting margins.
- No vendor lock in. If the program you're using to display it disappears you
  still have your writing.
- Easy to version control.

Here are a few places to learn and reference:

- [Interactive markdown tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/lesson/1/)
- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)
- [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

But the best way to learn it is to just use it!

## Updating the README

In the [git section](./git) we created a README. We've updated our project
though and now we need to add how to use our project.

```markdown
# ag-intro

This will be the second commit
This will be the third commit

## Requirements:

- gnumake

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/ag-intro`
